PSR Http Message - Hack Version
================

This repository holds all interfaces/classes/traits related to
[PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/).

Note that this is not a HTTP message implementation of its own. It is merely an
interface that describes a HTTP message. See the specification for more details.

## This is the Hack Version

This is a fork from [PHP-FIG](https://github.com/php-fig/http-message),
modified to Hack language.
