PSR Http Message - Hack Version
================

*This package is a fork from PHP-FIG ported to Hack language*

This repository holds all interfaces/classes/traits related to
[PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/).

Note that this is not a HTTP message implementation of its own. It is merely an
interface that describes a HTTP message. See the specification for more details.
